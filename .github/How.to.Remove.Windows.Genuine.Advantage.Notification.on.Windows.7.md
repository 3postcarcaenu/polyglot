Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) is a system that verifies the authenticity of your Windows license and notifies you if it is not genuine.

WGA Remover is a freeware application that can disable WGA notification and prevent it from running on Windows start-up. It is easy to use and does not require installation. You can download it from [here](https://wga-remover.en.lo4d.com/windows). To use WGA Remover, follow these steps:
 
1. Run the downloaded file and click on "Remove WGA".
2. Wait for the process to finish and restart your computer.
3. Enjoy your WGA-free Windows 7.

Note that WGA Remover does not make your Windows license genuine. It only removes the notification and stops the data transmission to Microsoft servers. You still need to purchase and activate a valid license to enjoy the benefits of a genuine Windows operating system. WGA Remover works only on Windows XP and Windows 7. For other versions of Windows, you may need to use other methods or tools to remove WGA notification.
  
Why does WGA notification appear on Windows 7? WGA notification is a part of the Windows Activation Technologies (WAT) that Microsoft introduced in 2009 to combat software piracy. WAT checks the validity of your Windows license periodically and displays a notification if it detects that your copy of Windows is not genuine. The notification may appear as a pop-up message, a watermark on the desktop, or a system tray icon. The notification may also limit some features and updates of Windows.
 
How to avoid WGA notification on Windows 7? The best way to avoid WGA notification on Windows 7 is to purchase and activate a genuine Windows license from Microsoft or an authorized reseller. You can check the status of your license by going to Control Panel > System and Security > System and looking at the Windows activation section. If your license is genuine, you will see a message that says "Windows is activated". If your license is not genuine, you will see a message that says "You may be a victim of software counterfeiting" or "This copy of Windows is not genuine". You can then follow the instructions to activate or purchase a genuine license.
 
What are the risks of using WGA Remover on Windows 7? WGA Remover is a third-party tool that modifies the system files and registry entries related to WGA. While it can remove WGA notification effectively, it may also cause some problems or risks for your computer. Some of these risks are:

- WGA Remover may not be compatible with some updates or patches of Windows 7. This may cause errors or instability in your system.
- WGA Remover may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or compromise your security. You should always scan the downloaded file with an antivirus program before running it.
- WGA Remover may violate the terms and conditions of Microsoft's End User License Agreement (EULA). This may result in legal actions or penalties from Microsoft.

Therefore, you should use WGA Remover at your own risk and discretion. You should also backup your important data and create a system restore point before using WGA Remover.
